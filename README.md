AAPL Stock Prediction with Random Forest

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict previous stock price movement (Up or Down) for Apple (AAPL).  
It includes data download, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and future predictions for 2025.
This project is not refined so feel free to utilize it however you wish, my current goal is to add more features to train the model on so the chances of it predicting down are not as prevalent and more logical predictions are set into motion.
